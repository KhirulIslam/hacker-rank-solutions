Description:
        Collections.sort:
           Collections class provides static methods for sorting the elements of collection. If collection elements are of Set or Map, we can
           use TreeSet or TreeMap.But we cannot sort the elements of List. Collections class provides methods for sorting the elements of
           List type elements also.


        Comparator interface
           Java Comparator interface is used to order the objects of user-defined class.This interface is found in java.util package and
           contains 2 methods compare(Object obj1,Object obj2) and equals(Object element).

             int compare(Object obj1, Object obj2)
                    obj1 and obj2 are the objects to be compared. This method returns zero if the objects are equal.
                    It returns a positive value if obj1 is greater than obj2. Otherwise, a negative value is returned.

              boolean equals(Object obj)
                    obj is the object to be tested for equality.The method returns true if obj and the invoking object are both
                    Comparator objects and use the same ordering. Otherwise, it returns false.
